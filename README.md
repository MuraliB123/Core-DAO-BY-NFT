# CreatorDAOx

**CreatorDAOx** empowers creators and influencers to make community-driven decisions through verifiable and decentralized voting. 
Whether itâ€™s deciding on the next VLOG destination or choosing the next AI tool to explore, decisions are shaped by the voice of the audienceâ€”secured via NFT-based ownership. 

These NFTs are not just access tokens; they are uniquely personalized and AI-generated using the creatorâ€™s portrait, adding sentimental and economic value. 
Being tradable on marketplaces, they fuel a vibrant secondary economy within the creator-fan ecosystem.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Personalized NFT Generation**  
   Creators generate custom avatars using a tailored Stable Diffusion model based on their portraits.

2. **NFT Minting**  
   The generated avatar is minted as an ERC-721 NFT and published on a Core Testnet.

3. **Poll Creation on DAO**  
   The creator sets up a decentralized poll related to upcoming content or decisions.

4. **Community Voting**  
   Fans and followers who own the creatorâ€™s NFT gain the right to vote in the DAO poll.

5. **Decentralized Decision Execution**  
   The decision with the most votes is transparently adopted, enabling collaborative content creation.

# FAQ
1. Is this scalable ?
   - Yes,
   - Instead of minting NFTs for every user, only a limited subset is minted based on demand or campaign cycles. 
   - NFTs are tradable in open marketplaces. This allows new participants to join DAO voting by purchasing NFTs, removing the need to mint for every new voter.
  
2. ðŸ”­ End Vision

 - The long-term goal is to release **CreatorDAOx** as an SDK, enabling developers and creators to seamlessly integrate DAO-based decision-making and NFT-gated voting on the Core Network within their own platforms and communities.

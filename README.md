# CreatorDAOx

**CreatorDAOx** empowers creators and influencers to make community-driven decisions through verifiable and decentralized voting. Whether itâ€™s deciding on the next VLOG destination or choosing the next AI tool to explore, decisions are shaped by the voice of the audienceâ€”secured via NFT-based ownership. 

These NFTs are not just access tokens; they are uniquely personalized and AI-generated using the creatorâ€™s portrait, adding sentimental and economic value. Being tradable on marketplaces, they fuel a vibrant secondary economy within the creator-fan ecosystem.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Personalized NFT Generation**  
   Creators generate custom avatars using a tailored Stable Diffusion model based on their portraits.

2. **NFT Minting**  
   The generated avatar is minted as an ERC-721 NFT and published on a Core Testnet.

3. **Poll Creation on DAO**  
   The creator sets up a decentralized poll related to upcoming content or decisions.

4. **Community Voting**  
   Fans and followers who own the creatorâ€™s NFT gain the right to vote in the DAO poll.

5. **Decentralized Decision Execution**  
   The decision with the most votes is transparently adopted, enabling collaborative content creation.
